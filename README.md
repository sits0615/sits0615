# 👋 Hi, I'm Universe Diamond

I'm a full-stack developer with 8+ years of experience specializing in web applications, AI integration, and video streaming. I’ve built enterprise tools like an Excel-to-web conversion using Vue.js and SharePoint, where I re-engineered complex formulas into a modular, data-driven web interface. In another project, I developed a real-time video streaming system using WebRTC and FFmpeg, optimizing for low-latency performance across unstable networks. I enjoy solving technical challenges with clean architecture and always aim to deliver scalable, user-friendly solutions.
